## Day 1/6: Manually setting up the project (Tuesday)

- [x] Babel
- [x] Webpack
- [x] React, React DOM, React Router, Redux
- [x] Tailwind (CSS framework)

## Day 2/6: Building all pages and navigation between them (Wednesday)

## Day 4/6: (Friday)

## Day 5/6: (Saturday)

- [x] I've managed to display all the fetched content into the main page, then I created a separated view named Details to store all the details about the selected character
  * Initially, I've displayed all details in the main page (names, descriptions, thumbnails, number of comics), but then I figured out that it there'd be no reason for a details page if all the details were there, so I sticked to the provided checklist.
- [ ] I tried to deploy the app in **Heroku** as well, but couldn't accomplish it yet unfortunately. Minor issues to  be solved later.

## Day 6/6

- [ ] Colocar todas as referências no README
- [ ] Colocar o logo da Marvel no README
- [ ] Give to the user the choice of loading a number of heroes (since pagination isn't possible within the remaining time)

* I've got another **error 429** at 2pm, so I started to do some other things.
