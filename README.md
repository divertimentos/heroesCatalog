## Day 1/6: Manually setting up the project (Tuesday)

- [x] Babel
- [x] Webpack
- [x] React, React DOM, React Router, Redux

## Day 2/6: Building all pages and navigation between them (Wednesday)

  - [x] Header
  - [x] Footer
- [ ] Login Screen
- [x] About Page

**PLUS**: I've managed to sucessfully fetch Marvel's API! It shortens one of the next steps, that is displaying all the date gathered into the main page.

## Day 3/6

## Day 4/6

## Day 5/6

- [ ] I've managed to display all the fetched content into the main page, then I created a separated view named Details to store all the details about the selected character
  * Initially, I've displayed all details in the main page (names, descriptions, thumbnails, number of comics), but then I figured out that it there'd be no reason for a details page if all the details were there, so I sticked to the provided checklist.
- [ ] I tried to deploy the app in **Heroku** as well, but couldn't accomplish it yet unfortunately. Minor issues to  be solved later.

## Day 6/6

- [ ] Colocar todas as referências no README
- [ ] Colocar o logo da Marvel no README
- [ ] Give to the user the choice of loading a number of heroes (since pagination isn't possible within the remaining time)
